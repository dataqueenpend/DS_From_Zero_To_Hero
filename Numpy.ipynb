        "##### What is NumPy?\n",
        "\n",
        "Numerical Python library - casually going by the name of **NumPy** - is a core Python package for scientific computing. It adds to the Python possibility to use **multi-dimensional arrays** and perform more advanced mathematical operations. \n",
        "\n",
        "NumPy is build with C, wrapped with a Python API. And precisely this C base is responsible for NumPy **high-performance and speed**.\n",
        "\n",
        "##### Why use NumPy?\n",
        "\n",
        "NumPy is **fast**, **useful** and allows the user to perform many different Data Science tasks with less amount of code. Furthermore, NumPy is an underlying library for other popular Python packages such as:\n",
        "* Matplotlib\n",
        "* Pandas\n",
        "* Scikit-learn\n",
        "\n",
        "and those above are a must in Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Data Science. To use other tools based on NumPy is good to know this library first - it is easier to understand them, if the user has a comprehension of the fundamentals behind them. \n",
        "\n",
        "##### NumPy Arrays\n",
        "\n",
        "Main object of NumPy is multi-dimensional table object called **ndarray**. Why 'nd'? It reffers to **n-number of dimensions**, which means that one can create with NumPy simple 1d-arrays as well as 2d-arrays, 3d-arrays and whatever number of dimensional array one want. \n",
        "\n",
        "All elements store in the Array are the same type. If upon a creation of array we pass to it **elements of different type**, they **will be unified to one** the most suitable. "
