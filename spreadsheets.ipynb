These are fields that you would want to use to filter and organize your data, but you won’t necessarily be performing any mathematical calculations on these fields. Measurements are the fields that you do want to perform mathematical calculations on. These are the fields that you would want to add together, such as Revenue, total inches of Rainfall, and so on. There are certainly cases where this dynamic can be flipped, but this will give you a good starting point.\n",
