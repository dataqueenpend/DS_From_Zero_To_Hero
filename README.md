# DS_From_Zero_To_Hero
My journey to becoming Data Scientist. 

In this repo I'm sharing all my daily Data Science learning - notes, exercises and code examples.

I have a lot of notes from my learning journey in my physical notebook, which I want to transfer into this repository for easier use. Also, I have in mind a little project, which could help to learn and remember Data Science extensive material. Stay tuned if you are interested.
